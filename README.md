# 📡 Tracking Lost Signals in Client-Server Events

**Hackathon Project Goal:** Identify gaps in user action signals (like clicks, scrolls, or navigations) sent from websites to analytics tools. These gaps can be caused by blockers such as ad blockers, browser policies, or system errors.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project helps detect discrepancies in user interaction signals between the client (browser) and server levels. It aims to identify causes for missing data, generate actionable insights, and improve the reliability of analytics tracking.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Track User Interactions**: Monitor user actions (clicks, scrolls, navigations) captured by beacon and conversion APIs on both the client and server.
- **Event Comparison**: Compare signals captured at the client and server levels to detect discrepancies.
- **Cause Detection**: Identify reasons for signal gaps, including:
   - Ad Blockers
   - Browser Restrictions
   - System Errors
- **Insight Generation**: Generate reports and insights to guide troubleshooting and debugging.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Client-Side Tracking**:
    - Capture user interactions via JavaScript event listeners.
    - Send signals using the `navigator.sendBeacon` API or custom conversion APIs.

2. **Server-Side Tracking**:
    - Receive and log signals sent from the client.
    - Store received signals for comparison.

3. **Signal Comparison**:
    - Compare events logged on the client and server.
    - Identify mismatches and missing data points.

4. **Gap Analysis**:
    - Analyze causes of signal gaps (e.g., blocked requests, network failures).
    - Categorize gaps by source (ad blockers, policies, errors).

5. **Insights and Reporting**:
    - Generate reports to visualize signal discrepancies.
    - Provide recommendations for troubleshooting.

## 📄 Usage

1. **Tracking User Events:**
    - Interact with the web application (clicks, scrolls, etc.).
    - Signals will be sent to the server automatically.

2. **Viewing Discrepancies:**
    - Check the dashboard for discrepancies between client and server events.

3. **Analyzing Gaps:**
    - Review reports to identify causes of missing signals.

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Signals Not Captured:**
   - Check for ad blockers or browser restrictions.
   - Ensure the server endpoint is reachable.

- **Data Mismatch:**
   - Compare timestamps and event metadata.
   - Verify the client-server communication integrity.
